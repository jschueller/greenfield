/**
 *
 *      An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for
 *      implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.
 *
 *      It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user
 *      interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as
 *      toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into
 *      xdg_surface roles.
 *
 *      Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order
 *      to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object
 *      using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given
 *      xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
 *      not based on xdg_surface.
 *
 *      A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the
 *      xdg_surface object.
 *
 *      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
 *      for the xdg_surface state to take effect.
 *
 *      Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
 *      committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
 *      manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
 *      also be treated as errors.
 *
 *      Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it
 *      possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that
 *      a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.
 *
 *      For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following
 *      conditions must be met:
 *      (1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface
 *      (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the
 *    role-dependent state to the surface
 *      (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface
 *
 *      A newly-unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out
 *      of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface
 *      has not been destroyed.
