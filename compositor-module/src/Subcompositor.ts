/**
 *
 *            The global interface exposing sub-surface compositing capabilities.
 *            A wl_surface, that has sub-surfaces associated, is called the
 *            parent surface. Sub-surfaces can be arbitrarily nested and create
 *            a tree of sub-surfaces.
 *
 *            The root surface in a tree of sub-surfaces is the main
 *            surface. The main surface cannot be a sub-surface, because
 *            sub-surfaces must always have a parent.
 *
 *            A main surface with its sub-surfaces forms a (compound) window.
 *            For window management purposes, this set of wl_surface objects is
 *            to be considered as a single window, and it should also behave as
 *            such.
 *
 *            The aim of sub-surfaces is to offload some of the compositing work
 *            within a window from clients to the compositor. A prime example is
 *            a video player with decorations and video in separate wl_surface
 *            objects. This should allow the compositor to pass YUV video buffer
 *            processing to dedicated overlay hardware when possible.
